## Business Problem
I hope to answer following questions in my notebook:

* Which countries have more Starbucks stores
* Which cities have more Starbucks stores
* Global distribution of Starbucks stores
* Distribution of Starbucks stores in China
* How Starbucks expands in Shanghai

# Methodology
In first step we have collected the required **Starbucks data: coordination, location and other information we need from Internet** . Most of the information is already filled. For those are missing, we use Foursquare to get the information we need.
Second step in our analysis will be **descriptive statistical analysis**. We will 
count the countries with the most starbucks and the cities with the most starbucks.
In third and final step we will **display the starbuck stores using folium**. To see how starbucks distributed worldwide and in China. We also tried to visualize starbuck stores according to their set up time.
